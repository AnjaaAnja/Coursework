                <p id="par">Death Note (stylized as DEATH NOTE) is a Japanese manga series
                    written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. The story
                    follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who stumbles across a mysterious
                    otherworldly notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to the
                    Shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill
                    anyone whose name is written in its pages.
                </p>
                <p id="decpar"> The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the
                    Death Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals whom he
                    deems morally unworthy of life to change the world into a utopian
                    society without crime, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named
                    "Kira" and the subsequent efforts of an elite task-force of law
                    enforcement officers, consisting of members of the Japanese police
                    force, led by L, an enigmatic international detective whose past is
                    shrouded in mystery, to apprehend him and end his reign of terror.
                </p>
